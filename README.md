Tutorial Javascript Functor - Examples

In functional programming, a functor is a concept that originates from category theory but has practical applications in programming languages like JavaScript. Essentially, a functor is a data structure that can be mapped over, meaning you can apply a function to every element inside the functor. In JavaScript, the most common example of a functor is an array.

To understand functors more deeply, letâ€™s break down the concept:
Key Concepts of a Functor

    Functor: A functor is a type that implements a map method which applies a given function to each element in the functor and returns a new functor of the same type.

    Mapping: The map method takes a function as an argument and applies this function to each element in the data structure, returning a new functor.

    Preservation of Structure: When a function is applied via map, the structure of the functor remains the same. For instance, mapping over an array results in another array.
